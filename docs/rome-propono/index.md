# ROME Propono

!!! warning
    ROME Propono is deprecated and will be removed with version 2.0.0

The ROME Propono subproject is a Java class library that supports publishing
protocols, specifically the Atom Publishing Protocol and the legacy MetaWeblog
API. Propono includes an Atom client library, an Atom server framework and a
Blog client that supports both Atom protocol and the MetaWeblog API.

Unfortunately the only documentation of ROME Propono could be extracted from the
following outdated source archives:

- [rome-propono-1.0RC1.tar.gz](rome-propono-1.0RC1.tar.gz)
- [rome-propono-1.0RC1.zip](rome-propono-1.0RC1.zip)
