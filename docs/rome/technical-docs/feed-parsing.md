# Feed parsing

!!! warning "TODO"
    This page needs to be revised

ROME is based around an idealized and abstract model of a Newsfeed or
"Syndication Feed". ROME can parse any format of Newsfeed, including RSS
variants and Atom, into this model. ROME can convert from model representation
to any of the same Newfeed output formats.

Internally, ROME defines intermediate object models for specific Newsfeed
formats, or "Wire Feed" formats, including both Atom and all RSS variants. For
each format, there is a separate parser class that parses XML into an
intermediate model. ROME provides "converters" to convert between the
intermediate Wire Feed models and the idealized Syndication Feed model.

Here is what happens during ROME Newsfeed parsing:

![](overview.png)

1. Your code calls *SyndFeedInput* to parse a Newsfeed.
2. SyndFeedInput delegates to WireFeedInput to do the actual parsing.
3. WireFeedInput uses a PluginManager of class FeedParsers to pick the right
   parser to use to parse the feed and then calls that parser to parse the
   Newsfeed.
4. The appropriate parser parses the Newsfeed into a *WireFeed*. If the Newsfeed
   is in an RSS format, the WireFeed is of class *Channel*. If the Newsfeed is
   in Atom format, then the WireFeed is of class *Feed*. In the end,
   WireFeedInput returns a WireFeed.
5. SyndFeedInput uses the returned WireFeedInput to create a SyndFeedImpl. Which
   implements SyndFeed. SyndFeed is an interface, the root of an abstraction
   that represents a format independent Newsfeed.
6. *SyndFeedImpl* uses a Converter to convert between the format specific
   WireFeed representation and a format-independent SyndFeed.
7. SyndFeedInput returns a SyndFeed containing the parsed Newsfeed.

## Extensions

ROME supports Newsfeed extension modules for all formats that also support
modules: RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, and Atom. Standard modules such as Dublic Core and
Syndication are supported and you can define your own custom modules too.
